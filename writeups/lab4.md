Lab 4 Writeup
=============

My name: llbbllbb2000

This lab took me about 10 hours to do.

Implementation Challenges:
1. the most challenging one is to understand the problem, and know that we should extract the TCPSegment from TCPSender and put them into segments_out in TCPConnection, which really confused me at the beginning.

2. felt a little lost when doing it. It was hard to finish and needed to started at some easy points, like the funciton "remaining_outbound_capacity", and then followed the instructions, doing the receiving segments part.
